You say it's changed
Show must go on, behave
오랜만에 옛 노래해
I'm feelin' like I never left
(That's right) I never left
But you ain't know, O.K then lights, camera
Act like you know
Don't play on me, no, we're
Airbnb, you're homeless
혼비백산-해진-미-장센 (Mise-en-scène)
도레미파시도 (Now, you know it)
두껍아 두껍아 came with the troops
뜯고 맛보고 즐기고 big bang when I shoot
King in the zoo, he gotta do what I do
One of one, not of them (Mirror)
Man in the views aimin' at you
Yeah, I'm aiming at a man, and amen, achoo
Bless you, all cleaned house, fu
